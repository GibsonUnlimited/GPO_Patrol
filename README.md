This utility has been built over a few months time, just in order to handle all the willy nilly policy creators.  We have acquired several 
businesses over the years, and inturn the initial inheritance of there gpo's.  WIth that, we absorb GPO's and have a bunch of clutter everywhere
Welp, i was officially tasked with, being the one..   Yup, I am him.  The Cleaner of the GPO's..  

Here is my utility that i have built to analyze by way of, 1 to 1, 1 to many, or ALL. You can drag and drop any gpo export file( xml / html ) into the text field for the comparison.  
You will see the versatility.  

WIll document more over the next few days.
